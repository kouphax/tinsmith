# Tinsmith

Tinsmith is a self-hostable web based Scala REPL.  It is effectively a copy of (codebrew.io)[http://codebrew.io] with a
a slightly different, more minimal feature set.  The name comes from an alternative name for a Tinker and this is what
you'd use this for - tinkering.

## Features

- Evaluates Scala code (you need to explicitly tell it)
- Returns the results of each step
- Returns any thrown exceptions or console output
- Saves current code into the URL so it's bookmarkable and shareable
- Random assortment of JARs on the classpath for use (__needs formalised a bit__)

## Running Locally

- `git clone git@github.com:kouphax/tinsmith.git`
- `cd tinsmith`
- `./sbt run`
- Navigate to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

## Usage

- `Alt-Enter` or `⌘-Enter` to evaluate the left hand side pane

## Demo

There is a live demo at [http://tinsmith.herokuapp.com](http://tinsmith.herokuapp.com)
