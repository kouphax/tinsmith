# Jed

*Gettext Style i18n for Modern JavaScript Apps*

For more info, please visit the docs site at <http://slexaxton.github.com/Jed>.

I also maintain [messageformat.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/messageformat.js). If you don't specifically need a gettext implementation, I might suggest using MessageFormat instead, as it has better support for plurals/gender and has built-in locale data.


## Current Version

`v0.5.2`

## Todo

* Build time generation of plural form functions
* Web interface for building translation sets
* Code introspection for default values

The sprintf implementation is from:

* Alexandru Marasteanu <alexaholic [at) gmail (dot] com>


## The name

The name jed.js is an homage to Jed Schmidt (<https://github.com/jed>) the JavaScript community member who is a japanese translator by day, and a "hobbyist" JavaScript programmer by night. Give your kids three character names and they'll probably get software named after them too.
