    <h3>Start Here</h3>
    <b>HTML5</b> is a great environment for building user interfaces.
    <br /><br />
    You can famously build your page using the most basic text editor, 
    and odds are, whatever platform you happen to be using has a handy 
    renderer (or three) available: a <b>browser</b>.
    <br /><br />
    It's easy to use HTML5 to <b>configure</b> and <b>compose</b> objects,
    but you can only choose from the short list of built-in elements.
    <br /><br />
    There are many wonderful tools in the world to <b>extend</b> what HTML5 
    can do, but they are all a little different. <b>What if</b> we could 
    all just extend HTML5 the same way: by making more elements.
    <br /><br />
    This is exactly what <b>Custom Elements</b> are about.
